####[x] Create your file structure: 
- [x] Create an index.html and styles.css file. 
- [x] Create a folder called `css` and put your styles.css file inside of it. The name of the folder should not be capitalized.
- [x] Link the styles.css file to index.html 

####[x] Build the layout using a mobile first design: 
- [x] Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document. See [Configuring the Viewport](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport#overview) to understand why and how to add this tag.
- [x] Look at the provided mockup for the *mobile device* and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.
- [x] Use the provided images for the portfolio gallery images shown in the mockups.
- [x] Use a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the text.
- [x] Use CSS to style your layout to match the provided mobile mockup. Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup at 320px screen size.

####[ ] Once you have everything in place for the mobile layout, use media queries to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
- [x] Match the design as it should look on a tablet device that is 768px wide and a desktop screen size that is 1024px wide.
- [x] Use a mobile-first approach by writing your media queries using the `min-width` property in your CSS.

####[x] Once all your breakpoints are in place, double check your layout matches the three mockups. 
- [x] The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups for mobile, tablet and desktop.
- [x] Feel free to replace the profile image and customize the text, but the layouts should match the mockups.

####[x] Link your navigation menu to the correct sections of the page using IDs to link to anchor tags. See this video on [Linking to Sections of a Web Page](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/linking-to-sections-of-a-web-page).

####[x] Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
  - [x] Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
  - [x] **There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:**
    - [x] Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
    - [x] If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
    - [x] If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.


####Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the [Student Project Submission Checklist](http://treehouse-techdegree.s3.amazonaws.com/Student-Project-Submission-Checklist.pdf). The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!

####[ ] Add an additional section to the page, such as a skills section. Don’t forget to create a working link to your new section in the navigation menu.

####[ ] Add at least TWO additional items to further style and enhance the portfolio:
  - [ ] A new background color for the navigation and/or main sections of the site.
  - [ ] Change the color of at least one piece of text.
  - [ ] Add one additional google font that is being used on the page.
  - [ ] Any additional styling for links (ie, borders, hover states).

####[x]When creating your navigation bar, use the [HTML5 `<nav>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) for extra structure and semantic markup.
